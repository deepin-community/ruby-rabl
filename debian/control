Description: Ruby templating library with JSON, BSON, XML and MessagePack support
 RABL (Ruby API Builder Language) is a Rails and Padrino Ruby templating system
 for generating JSON, XML, MessagePack, and BSON.
 .
 It allows one to easily:
  * create arbitrary nodes named based on combining data in an object
  * pass arguments to methods and store the result as a child node
  * render partial templates and inherit to reduce code duplication
  * rename or alias attributes to change the name from the model
  * append attributes from a child into a parent node
  * include nodes only if a certain condition has been met
